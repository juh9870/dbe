Every input string ID will be mapped to a numeric ID.

The mappings are guaranteed to be unique, unless the mappings file was edited \
to manually assign the same numeric ID to multiple string IDs.

Previously mapped IDs will be available according to entries in the mappings \

Node will fail if a new ID is requested and all configured ranges are exhausted

# Persistent mappings
Persistent mappings are a sane default for when you work with known string IDs \
that are generally not expected to change, or require to stay consistent between runs.
Persistent mappings are saved permanently, and will not be removed withot \
manual cleanup, so they are not a good choice for cases where IDs are dynamicly \
generated and prone to change.

# Non-persistent mappings
Non-persistent mappings are useful for dynamicly generated IDs, that are not \
required to stay consistent between runs. The main advantage of non-persistent \
mappings is that if structure of dynamicly generated IDs changes, the mappings \
will NOT need a manual cleanup.

Non-persistent mappings are still guaranteed to be stable within a single run

description = "Determines whenever mapping is expected to be a new mapping, an existing mapping, or any of the two"
docs = """
### Any
Any kind of mapping is allowed. This is the default value.

Usage of this mapping will not mark the mapping as "created", and so another \
node with `NewId` can use it at a later time.

### NewId
New ID is expected. This is useful for when you need to ensure that the string \
ID is not already used elsewhere.

This will mark the mapping as "created", and so another node with `NewId` will \
not be able to use it, and will throw an error, but will allow nodes with \
`ExistingId` to use it.

### ExistingId
> **Existing ID mapping is not yet implemented, blocked due to multistage runtime**

An existing ID is expected.

This will only work if the mapping was already created by a node with `NewId` \
in the **previous** stage of the execution. It will **not** respect IDs created in the same stage
